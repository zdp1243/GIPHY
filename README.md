# GIPHY
GIPHY API
This assignment consisted of making an API call to GIPHY and obtaining the top 10 results.
The instructions are that the GIPHS be static and move when the GIPHS are clicked.  A button was 
created for several GIPHS, and an array for other science fiction shows.  A science fiction show 
can be entered into the search field, and if it matches one in the array, a new button is created 
for that show.  If it doesn't match a show in the array, an alert tells you that your choice
wasn't cool enough. :-)
